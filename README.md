## Description
2D ecosystem simulation developed for a university group assignment.
## Features
- Main menu allowing customisation of the simulation.
- Procedurally generated terrain.
- Predator and Prey eat, drink, wander and breed.

- Predator and Prey handle their decision making via a statemachine.
- Pathfinding is handled by the A* algorithm.
- Random chance of events each day.
   - Famine
   - Disease
   - Migration
   - Sprout (food growing)
   - Flood
   - Drough
- Food grows and spreads across the map if left untouch.
- Simulation outputs a CSV for the graphing program.
